6156	Hi there! Great morning! I just remembered a fun memory of the two of us while I was brushing my teeth this morning. I don’t know if you remember that one crazy night when we just did one stupid thing after another, and we were helpless to stop it! It was such a life-changing experience, and I think we both agree that it made us straighten up and fly right. It’s been that long, my friend. Suffice it to say, we have been in each other’s lives longer than Brad and Angelina were together. Yes, this is my way of telling you that I love you and that we should definitely meet up soon. Hot ramen on me!	70	1	t
6157	Good morning, my favorite goofball. Time to rise and shine! We have this wonderful day to show the rest of the world just what you are made of. I want you to know that you have been such a big part of my journey. I would’ve given up a long time ago if it weren’t for your constant badgering and nagging. Sometimes I think you and my mom should hang out more often because you would totally hit it off! You have so many things in common! Just kidding. You know I love you. I am very blessed to have a friend like you who just cares and loves me so much. See you in a bit!	70	1	t

6160	Good morning, gorgeous! Are you up? I wish I was waking up beside you today. If I was, I’d be declaring it a no cellphone and no tablet kind of day. That way, we can just focus on each other and give each other the proper attention that we deserve. Agree? Maybe we can do this the next time you’re in town, or the next time I visit you. I cannot wait for this long-distance situation to be over. I don’t think my heart can take more of it. But I love you so much, and I’m willing to wait and make a sacrifice. I know that it’s going to be worth it. Call me when you get this, okay? I love you!	70	1	t
6161	Hi, honey. I just woke up. Good morning! Have you had breakfast already? I think I’m going to meet the girls for brunch, as soon as I find the strength to get out of this bed, shower, and find something clean to wear. Haha! I miss you, as usual. What’s new? I love you! Call me if you just want to eat or hang out. I don’t know if the plans that you made last night would push though or not, so just let me know if anything changes. I love you! Okay, that’s it. I love you!	70	1	t
